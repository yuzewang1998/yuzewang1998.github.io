Core motification is:
1. Polish and delete some useless text ( Original template contains many guidance for submit, please attention~~)
2. Sperate text and symbol. So that we can keep the symbol overall unification (Global Variance), and we only need to change the symbol once, it can brocast everywhere.
3. A colored table copied from WE-GS (original from NeRF). It not such beautiful, but qualified~~

This is a very simple template, most idea is from 
[SIGGRAPH TEMPLATE](https://github.com/budmonde/tog-template).
